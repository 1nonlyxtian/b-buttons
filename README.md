Now that we linked the stylesheet, let's start!

1. Create a `<a>` with a class of either `btn-sm`, `btn-md`, or `btn-lg` depending on the sizes and your desired color scheme (ex `red`).
2. Optional: You can also add a `disabled` class if you want to disable the button from further use.
3. Repeat Step 1 and 2 until necessary.
4. Don't forget to put in the content and close all tags.

There you have it. You now have a list that is more beautiful and more elegant. :)
